# RadioKit - Controller UI Skins (v3.0)

RadioKit v3.0 introduces **Absolute Height & Width Sizing** for all widgets, while maintaining a high-fidelity native vector engine for all skin packs.

---

## 1. Dimensional Scaling
|
Starting with v3.0, the layout engine uses absolute height and width units (0–200) to provide deterministic control over the dashboard layout:

- **Variable Scaling**: Slider and Text widgets allow independent `width` and `height` values.
- **Auto-Aspect**: Setting `width` to `0` enables the auto-aspect mode, where the widget calculates its own width based on its internal content (e.g., labels or number of items).
- **Fixed Scaling**: Widgets with fixed aspect ratios (Joystick, Knob, LED, Button, Switch) are sized primarily by their `height`. The `width` parameter is ignored for these widgets to preserve their natural geometry.

---

## 2. Pure Native Architecture

RadioKit skins now exclusively use Skia/Impeller-based rendering. Widgets are composed of high-quality SVG layers that are tinted and transformed in real-time.

### Key Features in v3.0:

- **No HTML/CSS**: Pure native rendering for maximum performance.
- **Decentralized Config**: Each widget is a self-contained folder in the skin pack.
- **Physics Simulator**: Animations driven by a high-fidelity **Spring Simulation** engine.

## 3. Directory Structure (.rkskin)

A Skin Pack is a ZIP archive (identifiable by the `.rkskin` extension). To add support for a widget, simply create a folder with the widget's name in the root of the pack.

```text
(skin-pack-name)/
├── manifest.json        # Global tokens and metadata
├── global/              # Shared assets (backgrounds, overlays)
├── button_push/         # Folder for RK_PushButton
├── button_toggle/       # Folder for RK_ToggleButton
├── slide_switch/        # Folder for RK_SlideSwitch
├── slider/              # Folder for RK_Slider
├── knob/                # Folder for RK_Knob
├── joystick/            # Folder for RK_Joystick
├── led/                 # Folder for RK_LED
├── display/             # Folder for RK_Text (display)
│   ├── bg.svg
│   ├── active.svg       # Shown when pressed
│   └── config.json      # Mapping and local animations
├── multiple_button/     # Folder for RK_MultipleButton
├── multiple_select/     # Folder for RK_MultipleSelect
└── joystick/            # Folder for RK_Joystick
    ├── base.svg
    ├── stick.svg
    └── config.json      # Physics parameters (damping, stiffness)
```

---

## 4. Global Manifest (`manifest.json`)

The manifest focuses purely on identity and visual tokens.

```json
{
  "name": "Neon Midnight",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "author": "RadioKit Team",
  "tokens": {
    "colors": {
      "primary": "#39FF14",
      "onPrimary": "#000000",
      "background": "#000000",
      "surface": "#111111",
      "onSurface": "#FFFFFF"
    },
    "typography": {
      "fontFamily": "Inter"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 5. Widget Configuration (`config.json`)

Each widget folder contains a `config.json` that defines its specific visual mapping and physical behavior.

### High-Fidelity Physics

RadioKit v3.0 uses a **Spring Simulation** for interactive elements like Joysticks, Sliders, and Knobs.

```json
{
  "layers": {
    "track": "track.svg",
    "thumb": "thumb.svg"
  },
  "physics": {
    "damping": 0.5,      // Damping ratio (0.1 to 1.0)
    "stiffness": 100.0,   // Spring stiffness (lower = softer)
    "mass": 1.0,         // Inertia of the component
    "deadzone": 0.05      // Center deadzone (%)
  }
}
```

> **Note**: Functional behavior (like self-centering) is defined by the hardware's `variant` byte. The `config.json` parameters purely define the **aesthetic character** of that behavior.

---

## 6. Real-time Reactivity

The RadioKit dashboard supports **instant theme switching**. When a user selects a new skin in the Gallery, the app:

1. Re-resolves all active widgets against the new skin folders.
2. Injects the new `SpringSimulation` parameters into the active animation controllers.
3. Swaps the SVG layers immediately without re-rendering the entire dashboard.

---

## 7. Built-in Skins

| Skin | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Default** | Light blue, modern, high contrast |
| **Dark** | Dark mode with blue accents |
| **Retro** | CRT green phosphor aesthetic |
| **Neon** | Cyberpunk neon glow effects |
| **Minimal** | Flat, minimal, no shadows |

---

## 8. Installation & Gallery

Skins can be imported manually using the `.rkskin` importer in the settings menu, or browsed in the **Theme Gallery** (Palette icon in the Control Screen).

### Custom Skin Creation

1. Create a new folder with your skin assets
2. Add a `manifest.json` with your color tokens
3. Add widget folders (`button_push/`, `slider/`, etc.) with SVG assets
4. Optional: Add `config.json` for physics tuning
5. Zip the folder and rename to `.rkskin`
6. Import via the Theme Gallery

---

## 9. Planned Features (TBD)

- **GLSL Shaders**: Support for custom vertex/fragment shaders for neon glows and CRT effects.
- **Sound Packs**: Associating specific sounds with widget interactions (clicks, slides).
- **Haptic Feedback Profiles**: Custom vibration patterns for mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Theming**: Runtime color palette generation from a single seed color.
